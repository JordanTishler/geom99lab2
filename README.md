differnce between API key and token

An API Key and an Authentication Token are two different ways of securing access to ArcGIS Developer resources.

An API Key is a simple code that is passed in by a client to identify the calling project and to provide access to the resources associated with the key. The API Key is typically used to access public data.

An Authentication Token, on the other hand, is used to securely identify the user making the request and to provide access to the user's private content and resources. The authentication token is passed in as a parameter in each API request.

In short, an API Key is used for accessing public data, while an Authentication Token is used for accessing private data and requires user authentication.
